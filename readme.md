Q1) Agile vs Devops

Answer) Key Differences:

An agile team is usually smaller in size, for collaboration and quicker reaction time. This caters to the rapid changes in customer behavior or needs. It is, however, the opposite for a DevOps team who are larger and who focus on quicker release times.

Agile methodology sees individuals as responsible for different roles throughout the process. In DevOps, they are accountable for everything. When it comes to targets, agile looks at software development and DevOps looks at providing sequential business solutions at a rapid pace.

The reduplication method linked to agile looks at prompt releases, feedback, and relationship building. DevOps brings all these teams together.

Agile is more well known for lean-approach. For DevOps, itâ€™s more about reducing costs. An agile approach is also geared for fluctuating change and DevOps places emphasis on regular testing and delivery.

The agile approach works in sprints, which can have durations ranging from a week to about a month. This is how teams manage their development schedule. On the other hand, DevOps emphasizes may have released several times a day.

Current business models, therefore, may require agile to move past a work environment that is static in comparison to DevOps where teams have to work together. There are distinct differences between both but be careful to not merely be an adopter of only one. They both harness the importance of collaboration and teamwork.

Organizations and development teams can utilize both to complement the other. At the end of the day, the needs of the user always need to be top of mind. Both of these approaches consider this and are flexible so that they can easily adjust to changes in requirements.

Q2) Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment 

Answer 2) Continuous Integration is the practice where developers merge the changes to the code base to the main branch as often as possible. Continuous Delivery is an extension of CI since it enables automation to deploy all the code changes to an environment (dev, qa, stage, prod, etc) after the changes have been merged. Continuous Deployment takes the process one step further than continuous delivery. Here, all changes that pass the verification steps at each stage in the pipeline are released to production. Continuous delivery is a partly manual process where developers can deploy any changes to customers by simply clicking a button, while continuous deployment emphasizes automating the entire the process.
